# SchemaMonkey

SchemaMonkey is a behind-the-scenes gem to facilitate writing other gems that extend ActiveRecord.  It provides:

* A "middleware"-style interface to key ActiveRecord internal functions.  For example, there's a middleware hook to let you insert a handler for migration column definition options, and there are several hooks to insert handlers for the various parts of a schema dump.

* A convention-based protocol for `include`'ing custom modules into ActiveRecord.  You just define your modules and SchemaMonkey will automatically include them in the right places.

* It takes care of setting up the Railtie appropriately to invoke the gems.

The middleware interface has two benefits: it provides a clean API so that the client gems don't need to monkey-patch ActiveRecord (SchemaMonkey does all the monkey-patching for you), and it lets the client gems operate in parallel without concern about conflicting monkey-patches.


## Installation

In your gem's `gemspec`, specify a dependency:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency "schema_monkey", "~> <MAJOR>.<MINOR>", ">= <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>"
```

SchemaMonkey follows semantic versioning; it's a good idea to explicitly use the `~>` and `>=` dependencies to make sure your gem's clients don't accidentally pull in a version of SchemaMonkey that your gem isn't compatible with.

## Compatibility

SchemaMonkey is tested on:

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: MATRIX - begin -->
<!-- These lines are auto-generated by schema_dev based on schema_dev.yml -->
* ruby **1.9.3** with rails **4.2**, using **mysql2**, **sqlite3** or **postgresql**
* ruby **2.1.5** with rails **4.2**, using **mysql2**, **sqlite3** or **postgresql**

<!-- SCHEMA_DEV: MATRIX - end -->

## Usage


**Sorry -- no real documentation yet.  Will get to that as soon as I can.**



## Development & Testing

Are you interested in contributing to schema_monkey?  Thanks!  Please follow
the standard protocol: fork, feature branch, develop, push, and issue pull request.

Some things to know about to help you develop and test:

* **Ugh -- no specs yet.  SchemaMonkey is currently tested indirectly by testing the client gems that use it.  That's another thing to get to as soon as I can.**

* **schema_dev**:  SchemaMonkey uses [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) to
  facilitate running rspec tests on the matrix of ruby, rails, and database
  versions that the gem supports, both locally and on
  [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/SchemaPlus/schema_monkey)

  To to run rspec locally on the full matrix, do:

        $ schema_dev bundle install
        $ schema_dev rspec

  You can also run on just one configuration at a time;  For info, see `schema_dev --help` or the
  [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) README.

  The matrix of configurations is specified in `schema_dev.yml` in
  the project root.
